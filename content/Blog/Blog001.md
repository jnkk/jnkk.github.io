# Hopes and dreams
Build a homelab for learning a lot of stuff, adding CCTV, and the most important thing a NAS.
Storage is really important for the modern era. For now cloud services like Google Cloud and right now, Github.  
My code is saved there, I hope.  

The ultamite goal is a smart home system with automation.
